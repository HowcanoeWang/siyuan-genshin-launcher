# Installation Notes

* <b style='color:red'>This plugin achieves its functionality by replacing files in the installation directory, which will affect all workspaces!</b>
* Currently only supports Windows and MacOS, with Windows requiring administrator privileges for replacement.
* The Linux version does not work after restarting due to AppImage running in a temporary folder each time.
* The f\*\*king stupid file permission in the Android 11+ completely blocks this technical approach.
* Reinstalling SiYuan can solve all issues caused by this plugin.
* Remember to enable the lock screen feature in `Settings` - `About` - `Access Authorization Code` for better experience.
* The lock screen page has background music, but Chrome security permissions require manual click to trigger playback.

# Features

* [X] Startup page simulates Genshin Impact UI.
* [X] Lock screen page simulates Genshin Impact UI and changes with local time.
* [X] Loading page with Genshin Impact loading icon.
